'''

You may notice there are a TON of #comments in here, this is to make it as easy as possible for you to understand how this code functions.
Too many comments probably. But feedback on the beta was that there wasn't enough comments, and there were already a lot then, soooo...
ANYWAYS, this code is FREE, so if someone sold this to you, I'm sorry to say that you got scammed. Poor you.
Nothing here was skidded, everything here was made by yours truly, aside from Tomer8007's api, obviously.
You're welcome to modify this as much as you'd like! Have fun <3
- Stetho

P.S:
I don't mind people "skidding" this at all, that's what I made it open source for.
So long as people aren't impersonating me or claiming they made the original copy, it's totally fine for people to modify and repost this script.
Exploring and playing with existing code is how a lot of new developers learn, so quit harrassing people for it!
